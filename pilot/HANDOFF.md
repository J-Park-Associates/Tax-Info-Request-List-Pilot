# Pilot handoff

## Done

- **Job 0 (2026-09-28):** pilot started from the original's `main` at `a2d6af4`
  (PR #139, decision 209); `README.md`, `DECISIONS.md`.
- **Job 1 (2026-09-28):** [`SPEC.md`](SPEC.md) written; decisions P8-P16 added.
- **Move (2026-09-28, P17-P19):** the pilot now lives in its own repository,
  `J-Park-Associates/Tax-Info-Request-List-Pilot`, whose `main` is the pilot.
  SPEC gained section 3a (the pilot's own names on the PC and the two-folder
  deny list). The renames are **not made yet**: Build A makes them first.

- **Build C (2026-09-28, P21, branch `claude/festive-mayer-wpxbo2`, draft PR to
  `main`):** SPEC section 12 built - the saved schedule choice, every
  registration path using it, the "off" outcome, the launch comparison, the
  `set-schedule` command and `vocab.schedule`, the Schedule button and dialog,
  the once-a-day wording, the interval-aware last-pass rule, the runbook
  passages and the 12.8 tests. Gate run: ruff, repo-map `update` and `check`,
  the affected tests under Python 3.11 and 3.13 (all pass except four
  `test_ocr.py` tests and four setup errors that need `onnxruntime`/`rapidocr`,
  which the cloud venv lacks; Build C touches no OCR code).
  - **Deviations from SPEC 12 for the next reader:**
    1. The choice, its checks (`check_start`, `check_every`, `EVERY_CHOICES`,
       `ScheduleChoiceError`, `SchedulePreference`) and the two defaults live in
       `tracker/settings.py`, not `scheduling.py`. The runner must read the
       saved interval for the last-pass line and may not import `scheduling`
       (`tests/test_layers.py`), and `settings` may not import upward.
       `scheduling` re-exports the names, so `scheduling.check_start` etc.
       work as the SPEC says. `scheduling.DEFAULT_START` /
       `DEFAULT_REPEAT_MINUTES` are now aliases of the settings defaults.
    2. `runner.LAST_PASS_NEVER` no longer says "within two hours" (untrue for a
       longer interval); `LAST_PASS_OLD` is now a template taking `{hours}`.
       New: `LAST_PASS_OFF`, `LAST_PASS_AMBER_HOURS_DAILY`, `amber_hours()`.
    3. `settings` also returns `schedule_problem` (a sentence) and
       `schedule: null` when a hand-edited value is refused; the dialog shows
       the sentence and starts from the defaults.
    4. Extra: `vocab.schedule.loading` (the dialog's loading line), and a few
       CSS lines for the dialog in `style.css`.
    5. The runbook's move step says a move keeps the saved time and interval.
  - **Merge notes:** B and C both edit `index.html` (different spots). Both
    edit `docs/repo-map.*`: merge, then `python tools/repo_map.py update`,
    never hand-resolve.
  - **Decision text to log** (the integrate session numbers it): none new;
    P21 covers this build.

## Waiting on Jason

Nothing. Terms (P20) and tour (P22) wording approved; Actions are off in this
repository; the old `pilot/first-edition` branch is deleted from the original.

## Next: run the sessions in [`PROMPTS.md`](PROMPTS.md) (P23)

1. **Prompts 1, 2, 3 in parallel** (Sonnet): Build A (names and installer),
   Build B (badge, terms, tour), Build C (schedule setting). Each pushes its
   session branch and opens a draft pull request to `main`.
2. **Prompt 4** (Opus, high effort): one review of all three pull requests,
   findings in `pilot/reviews/review-1.md`.
3. **Prompt 5** in each build session that has findings.
4. **Prompt 6** (Opus): confirm fixes, merge B -> A -> C, gate, write
   `pilot/RELEASE.md`.

## Then

- **Job 3:** opus review, high effort, in a session that built nothing:
  numbered findings against `SPEC.md`; rebuild/review loop.
- **Job 4 (Jason, office PC, on a copy of client folders - P15, P18):** run
  `pilot\Build Pilot Installer.bat`, install, accept terms, run the tour on a
  copy of client folders, uninstall, confirm the clients folder, data folder
  and `settings.json` remain and the scheduled task is gone.
- **Job 5:** once Builds A, B and C are merged, reviewed and checked on Windows, tag `pilot-0.1` (never `v*`) and send the
  installer and `Tester Guide.md`.

## Environment notes for cloud sessions

`pip install -r requirements.lock` fails in the cloud container (a wheel will
not build) and the system `cryptography` breaks `pypdf`. Use a fresh virtual
environment and install only what the affected tests need:
`pytest==9.1.1 ruff==0.14.3 pypdf==6.19.0 openpyxl==3.1.5`.
